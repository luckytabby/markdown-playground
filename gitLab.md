# Getting started with Git Lab
## Instructions
In this lab, we'll be going through some basic tasks you'll need to do as you manage the GitHub repository for your CollectionBuilder site. The questions below are designed to help you learn and remember what you need to do to perform these tasks, as well as where you can go to look for help. 
## Creating your repository and editing files
**What did you click on to create a new repository in the web interface of Github (i.e., on Github.com)?**  
I opened github.com to the dashboard, which has a list of my top repositories on the lefthand side, and clicked the little green "new" button there.  
**What is the difference between a private and a public repository?**  
The contents of a public repository are available for anyone to view. Only authorized users can see the contents of a private repository.  
**Once your repository has been made and has at least one file, what button do you need to click on the web interface in order to create a new file in your repository?**  
I usually click the "add file" button on the main repository page.  
**Describe the steps you took to clone your repository on Github Desktop**  
I just hit file, clone repository and then chose markdown-playground out of my list of repositories. Then, I fetched the origin to my machine and got started working on desktop.

GitHub docs  
**What is the URL for GitHub documentation on creating your first repository?**
https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop  
**Where is your local repository versus the remote repository?**  
My local repository is on my machine, the remote repository is on GitHub.com.  
**What happens when you fetch?** 
GitHub Desktop retrieves any changes that have happened to your repository online.  
**What happens when you pull changes/commits?**
You summon all the updates made to whatever branch of the repository you're working on to your machine.  
**When working on GitHub Desktop, what order should you generally perform push, pull, and fetch?**
You should generally fetch, then pull, then push.
**What happens when you push commits from your local repository?**
When you push commits, they are pushed to the remote repository from your machine.  
**What is the URL for the Github glossary?**
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary  
**Where can you find a list of your commits?**
Add /commits to the end of the main URL for your repository, and bam, you're there.  
**What is the URL for documentation on reverting a commit?**
https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/reverting-a-commit-in-github-desktop  
**How do you revert a commit?**
Hop on GitHub Desktop, right click the commit you want to revert, then click "Revert Changes in Commit".  

## Git-flavored markdown
**What is the name of the page or URL in GitHub documentation where there's information on how to format your Markdown for GitHub?**

Two hashtags  
**How do you indicate text that has been struckthrough?**  
Two squiggly dashes on each side  
**How do you create a hyperlink in your markdown?**    
[Text goes here](Actual link goes here)  
**How do you link to a section in the same or another markdown file?**  
GitHub parses anchor tags out of section headers, so you should just be able to link with a [Text for link goes here](A hashtag then the section title goes here).  
**What are the three possible symbols for indicating an unordered list?**  
You can use * or  
**Format the following text into a footnote:**
